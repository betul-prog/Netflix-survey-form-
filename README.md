# Netflix-survey-form-
survey form
1. Welcome today lesson. I'm Ed. This is my first english lesson, thanks for understanding for my errors.

1. We will do netflix-survey-form project today

1. I will create div tag.

1. id should be unique for best practice.

1. `<p class="paragraph">This is a paragraph.</p>`  
   ----Start Tag-------|----content--------|--End Tag  
   ------------ Element ---------------------------

1. I will add `id` because we have just one form-header.
   If i have multiple form-header i should use class.

1. What is figma?
   Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows. The Figma Mirror companion apps for Android and iOS allow viewing Figma prototypes in real-time on mobile devices.

   Developer don't need to think which color should i use? Designer design it with figma. We just implement this design to our project.

1. We can centerize an element with `margin: auto;`

1. You can give a name/id/class whatever you want.
